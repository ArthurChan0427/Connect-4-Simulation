Notes and Assumptions:
   This program is a video simulation of the board game Connect 4. In a basic game of Connect 4, two players take
   turn dropping a piece of a distinct colour (typically red vs. yellow) into a 6 x 7 board. The objective is
   to be the first to achieve a sequence of 4 connected pieces in any of the 4 orientations (vertical, horizontal,
   positive diagonal, negative diagonal).
   
   In addition to the basic mechanics of Connect 4, players can choose to delete (or pop out) a piece of their own
   colour located at the bottom row as a single move, which causes all existing pieces above to drop by 1 unit. This 
   allows for a greater strategic depth while preventing the match to end in a stalemate when the 42 slots of the
   board are completely filled.
